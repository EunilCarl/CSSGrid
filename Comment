It is Feb 19 2023, i have learned CSS Grid and i think this is my last time learning html and css because i will proceed on learning
javascript.

I thought CSS Grid will be hard but it's actually not lol, but ofc i watch a fricking tons of videos to learn css grid
anyways it was worth it. Btw i've applied for BNHS as BSCS (Computer Science) i hope that i can pass the entrance exam

Wish me Luck
